           The average performance of countries mask large difference within their education systems. In general, the differences between students and schools in each country are larger or comparable to differences between countries. However, in some countries these disparities are higher, while in some smaller and the education systems should be compared not only in terms of average performance but also how unequal are the results of their students. One way of looking at differences between students is to compare how many of them reach international benchmarks, which in PISA are called proficiency levels. In reading, PISA 2018 reports results using nine proficiency levels. Detailed definitions of each level are provided in chapter 2, while below student results are reported. Chart compares distribution of students across reading proficiency levels in Saudi Arabia and compares that to the average OECD distribution. There are two key benchmarks in PISA that are used to compare countries. The proficiency level 2 is the basic proficiency benchmark, which is used across countries to compare the percentage of students that do not possess sufficient reading skills to participate in the economy and society. In European Union, this benchmark is used to monitor how member countries fight with student underperformance. In many other countries similar performance benchmarks were established and it is generally accepted that most students should demonstrate reading skills above this benchmark at the age of 15.

        Figure compares scores at the 10th percentile of reading performance distribution across the countries with the largest education systems. One can note that even low-achieving students in the four Chinese provinces outperform most students in other countries scoring around 450 points on the PISA scale. In other top-achieving countries, the weakest students also perform quite high, e.g. above 380 points in Canada and Poland, or above 370 points in Korea, Japan, or the United Kingdom. In Saudi Arabia, but also in the United Arab Emirates, low-achieving students perform at very low levels around 280 score points meaning that their lack basic reading skills and are not able to answer most of the PISA test reading items. These students demonstrate reading skills level that is highly unsatisfactory considering that they spent nearly 10 years in formal education. On the other hand, performance of the weakest students is similarly low not only in the UAE, but also in countries like Brazil or Malaysia, and very similar to performance of the relatively weakest students in Jordan.
        </br></br>
                              Figure shows similar comparisons for the highest-achieving students, i.e. those with reading scores at the 90th percentile for a country distribution. A list of countries at the top is slightly different now. Again, students from China, Canada, Korea and Poland are in the top ranking positions among the best students from larger education systems, but performance of the best achieving students in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, or Taipei is similarly high. Interestingly, the gap between the best students in China and in other countries is much smaller now with a very close performance of the best students from, for example, the United States. But while the best US students rank third among countries, the weakest US students are only 9th in this ranking. The gap between them and their Chinese peers is around 80 score points at the 10th percentile (among the weakest students) and only 23 score points among the 90th percentile (among the best students). This shows that the average advantage of Chinese students is mostly driven by their relatively higher performance of their weakest students, while performance of the best students is more similar across the best countries. It is obviously due to larger differences in student performance withing the United States and some other countries which we discuss in detail at the end of this chapter. Overall, in a number of countries students at the top of the reading performance distribution (90th percentile) show very good performance. In China, but also in Canada, United States, Australia, Korea, Poland, UK, Germany, Taipei, Japan, France, and Portugal, top 10% of students have scores of 600 points or higher meaning they are highly proficient readers. In Saudi Arabia, the best students perform at slightly above 500 score points, which is just above the OECD average of 487 points. In comparison, while low-achieving students perform similarly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the top performing students in UAE score much higher at above 580 points.
